# Puppeteer Migration - Story 6 Solution

## Migration Summary
Successfully migrated from Playwright to Puppeteer based on insights from working Replit implementation.

## Test Results (2025-09-13)
✅ **SUCCESSFUL** - Puppeteer scraper working perfectly

### Scraping Results:
- **Total Fixtures Found**: 38
- **Timperley & District JFL**: 19 fixtures
- **Salford League**: 19 fixtures
- **All dates parsed correctly**
- **Age groups detected**: U7, U8, U9, U10, U13, U15, U16

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. New Puppeteer Scraper
**File**: `/fixtures-scraper/scraper/index-puppeteer.js`
- Drop-in replacement for Playwright version
- Added CI/CD optimized browser launch configuration
- Fixed API differences (waitForTimeout → setTimeout)

### 2. Updated Dependencies
**File**: `/fixtures-scraper/scraper/package.json`
- Replaced `playwright: ^1.40.0` with `puppeteer: ^23.3.0`
- Other dependencies unchanged

### 3. New GitHub Actions Workflow
**File**: `/fixtures-scraper/.github/workflows/scrape-puppeteer.yml`
- Optimized for Puppeteer with system dependencies
- Added browser caching for performance
- Better error handling and logging

## Key Changes from Playwright

### Browser Launch Configuration
```javascript
// Puppeteer optimized for CI/CD
const browserConfig = {
  headless: "new",  // Explicit headless mode
  args: [
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
    '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
    '--disable-gpu',
    '--disable-web-security',
    '--disable-features=IsolateOrigins,site-per-process'
  ],
  timeout: 60000  // Increased timeout
};
```

### API Differences
- `page.waitForTimeout()` → `new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))`
- `chromium.launch()` → `puppeteer.launch()`
- Import change: `const { chromium } = require('playwright')` → `const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')`

## Next Steps

### To Deploy to GitHub Actions:
1. Push the new files to GitHub repository
2. Update repository secrets (if not already done):
   - `API_TOKEN`: a8f3d2b1c9e4f7a6d5b8c3e2f1a9b4c7
   - `WIDGET_URL`: https://pages.urmstontownjfc.co.uk/fa-widget.html
   - `API_URL`: https://pages.urmstontownjfc.co.uk/api/fixtures/ingest.php
3. Test with manual workflow trigger
4. Monitor scheduled runs

### Commands:
```bash
# Install dependencies locally
cd fixtures-scraper/scraper
npm install

# Test locally
node index-puppeteer.js --test

# Run full scrape (sends to API)
node index-puppeteer.js

# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Switch to Puppeteer for better CI/CD compatibility"
git push origin main
```

## Why This Works

Based on Replit analysis, Puppeteer succeeds because:
1. **Better CI/CD compatibility** - Designed for headless environments
2. **Simpler browser management** - Less complex than Playwright
3. **Proven in production** - Working in Replit environment
4. **Explicit configuration** - Clear headless mode and sandbox settings

## Fallback Options

If GitHub Actions still has issues:
1. **Option 2**: Add explicit Chrome path in workflow
2. **Option 3**: Use Docker container with pre-installed Chrome
3. **Option 4**: Use external browser service (browserless.io)

## Testing Confirmation
