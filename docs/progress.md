# Fixtures System Improvements - Progress Tracker
**Date**: 2025-09-13
**System**: Urmston Town JFC Fixtures Scraper
**Engineer**: AI Assistant (Claude)

## üéØ What We Set Out to Achieve

### Primary Objectives
1. **Implement 7-day rolling window** - Only store fixtures for today + next 6 days
2. **Delete-before-insert pattern** - Remove all fixtures before inserting new data to prevent stale records
3. **Simplify database operations** - Remove complex UPSERT logic that could cause duplicates

### Business Requirements
- Help managers see upcoming pitch allocations
- Identify potential pitch clashes
- No need for historical data retention
- Cleaner, more maintainable system

## ‚úÖ What We Successfully Achieved

### 1. Lambda Function Updates ‚úÖ
**File Modified**: `/fixtures-scraper/lambda/index-lambda.js`
- Added date filtering logic after fixture extraction
- Successfully filters fixtures to 7-day window (today + 6 days)
- Deployed to AWS Lambda in eu-north-1 region
- **Result**: Reduced fixtures from 38-45 to consistently 5 fixtures

### 2. AWS Deployment ‚úÖ
- Successfully built and pushed Docker container to ECR
- Updated Lambda function with new code
- Tested via AWS CLI invocation
- Lambda execution working correctly with 7-day filter

### 3. PHP File Deployment Process ‚úÖ
- Successfully navigated Hostinger File Manager
- Located and edited ingest.php file
- Saved changes through web interface

## üîÑ What We Changed

### Lambda Changes (index-lambda.js)
```javascript
// Added after line 263 (after fixture transformation)
// Filter to only include fixtures within the next 7 days (today + 6 days)
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Start of today

const sevenDaysFromNow = new Date(today);
sevenDaysFromNow.setDate(sevenDaysFromNow.getDate() + 7); // End of 7th day

const filteredFixtures = transformedFixtures.filter(fixture => {
  const fixtureDate = new Date(fixture.date);
  return fixtureDate >= today && fixtureDate < sevenDaysFromNow;
});
```

### PHP Changes (ingest.php)
```php
// Replaced UPSERT logic with:
// DELETE ALL FIXTURES FIRST (clean slate approach)
$deleteSql = "DELETE FROM fixtures";
$deleteStmt = $pdo->prepare($deleteSql);
$deleteStmt->execute();
$stats['fixtures_deleted'] = $deleteStmt->rowCount();

// Now simple INSERT for all fixtures
$insertSql = "INSERT INTO fixtures (fixture_date, home_team, away_team, venue, competition, home_score, away_score, status, age_group, raw_data) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
```

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolution

### 1. SSH Deployment to Hostinger
- **Issue**: SSH requires password authentication
- **Attempted**: Both SCP and SSH pipe methods
- **Error**: Permission denied (password required)
- **Solution**: Used browser-based File Manager successfully

### 2. PHP Endpoint Runtime Error - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: ingest.php had duplicated content (11KB instead of 7KB)
- **Root Cause**: Content was duplicated during browser deployment
- **Solution**: Replaced with clean version via File Manager
- **Result**: Endpoint now working correctly (HTTP 200)

## üìö Important Processes Documented

### How to Deploy to Hostinger via Browser

#### Prerequisites
- Hostinger credentials (stored in `/HOSTINGER_CREDENTIALS.md`)
- Playwright MCP tool configured in Claude

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Launch Browser Session**
   ```
   Use Playwright MCP browser_navigate tool
   Navigate to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
   ```

2. **Login to Hostinger**
   - User will need to manually enter credentials
   - Or session may already be authenticated

3. **Navigate to File Manager for Subdomain**
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Don't use the main File Manager link
   - Use the **search bar** at the top of hPanel
   - Search for: "file manager"
   - Select: "pages.urmstontownjfc.co.uk - File Manager"
   - This opens the correct subdomain's file system

4. **Navigate to Target File**
   ```
   public_html/ ‚Üí api/ ‚Üí fixtures/ ‚Üí [target file]
   ```

5. **Edit File**
   - Double-click file to open editor
   - Select all (Ctrl+A) to replace content
   - Paste new content
   - Click "Save" button

### How to Test the System

#### Test Lambda Function
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=footballclub
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name urmston-fixtures-scraper \
  --region eu-north-1 \
  output.json

cat output.json | jq
```

#### Test PHP Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST https://pages.urmstontownjfc.co.uk/api/fixtures/ingest.php \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer a8f3d2b1c9e4f7a6d5b8c3e2f1a9b4c7" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fixtures":[{"date":"2025-09-14","home_team":"Test","away_team":"Other","venue":"Venue"}]}'
```

#### Check Lambda Logs
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=footballclub
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/urmston-fixtures-scraper \
  --region eu-north-1 \
  --since 5m \
  --format short
```

## üîß System Architecture Notes

### AWS Infrastructure
- **Region**: eu-north-1 (Stockholm)
- **Lambda**: urmston-fixtures-scraper
- **ECR Repository**: Contains Docker image with Puppeteer
- **EventBridge**: Scheduled triggers at 9 AM and 3 PM daily
- **AWS Profile**: footballclub (in ~/.aws/credentials)

### Hostinger Infrastructure
- **Domain**: pages.urmstontownjfc.co.uk
- **File Path**: /public_html/api/fixtures/
- **Database**: MySQL (u790502142_fixtures)
- **PHP Version**: 8.2.28
- **Web Server**: LiteSpeed

### Data Flow
1. EventBridge triggers Lambda on schedule
2. Lambda scrapes FA widget page using Puppeteer
3. Lambda filters fixtures to 7-day window
4. Lambda sends filtered fixtures to PHP endpoint
5. PHP deletes all existing fixtures
6. PHP inserts new fixtures
7. Website reads from database to display fixtures

## ‚úÖ System Fully Operational

### All Issues Resolved
- **PHP Endpoint**: Fixed duplicated content, now returns clean JSON responses
- **Lambda Function**: Successfully filtering to 7-day window
- **Database Operations**: DELETE-then-INSERT pattern working perfectly
- **API Integration**: Full data flow from scraper ‚Üí database ‚Üí public API

### Debugging Process That Worked
1. Identified file duplication issue (11KB vs expected 7KB)
2. Used Hostinger File Manager to replace corrupted file
3. Deployed clean version of ingest.php
4. Verified with curl tests - HTTP 200 responses
5. Confirmed end-to-end flow with Lambda invocation

## üìä Test Results

### Before Changes
- Fixtures scraped: 38-45 (varying)
- Time window: Unlimited
- Database pattern: UPSERT (check existence, then update or insert)

### After Changes - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- Fixtures scraped: 38-45 initially
- Fixtures sent to API: 5 (filtered to 7-day window)
- Time window: 7 days (today + 6)
- Database pattern: DELETE ALL then INSERT
- **Status**: Lambda ‚úÖ | PHP ‚úÖ | System ‚úÖ

## üîÑ Progress Timeline
- **14:00** - Started implementation, analyzed requirements
- **14:30** - Modified Lambda code with 7-day filter
- **14:45** - Modified PHP code with delete-before-insert pattern
- **15:00** - Deployed Lambda to AWS successfully
- **15:35** - Lambda tested and confirmed working (5 fixtures)
- **15:40** - Attempted SSH deployment (failed - password required)
- **15:45** - Switched to browser-based deployment via Playwright

- **16:00** - Identified file duplication problem (11KB vs 7KB)
- **16:05** - Redeployed clean PHP file via File Manager
- **16:07** - System fully operational - all tests passing ‚úÖ

## üéâ Final Status: COMPLETE

### System Performance
- **Lambda executions**: Successful, filtering to 5 fixtures
- **PHP endpoint**: HTTP 200, processing fixtures correctly
- **Database**: Storing only 7-day window (5 fixtures currently)

### Business Impact
‚úÖ Managers can now see only upcoming pitch allocations
‚úÖ No stale fixture data cluttering the system
‚úÖ Simplified maintenance with DELETE-then-INSERT pattern
‚úÖ Reduced data storage from 40+ to ~5 fixtures
