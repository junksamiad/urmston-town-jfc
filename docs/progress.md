# Fixtures System Improvements - Progress Tracker
**Date**: 2025-09-13
**System**: Urmston Town JFC Fixtures Scraper
**Engineer**: AI Assistant (Claude)

## üéØ What We Set Out to Achieve

### Primary Objectives
1. **Implement 7-day rolling window** - Only store fixtures for today + next 6 days
2. **Delete-before-insert pattern** - Remove all fixtures before inserting new data to prevent stale records
3. **Simplify database operations** - Remove complex UPSERT logic that could cause duplicates

### Business Requirements
- Help managers see upcoming pitch allocations
- Identify potential pitch clashes
- No need for historical data retention
- Cleaner, more maintainable system

## ‚úÖ What We Successfully Achieved

### 1. Lambda Function Updates ‚úÖ
**File Modified**: `/fixtures-scraper/lambda/index-lambda.js`
- Added date filtering logic after fixture extraction
- Successfully filters fixtures to 7-day window (today + 6 days)
- Deployed to AWS Lambda in eu-north-1 region
- **Result**: Reduced fixtures from 38-45 to consistently 5 fixtures

### 2. AWS Deployment ‚úÖ
- Successfully built and pushed Docker container to ECR
- Updated Lambda function with new code
- Tested via AWS CLI invocation
- Lambda execution working correctly with 7-day filter

### 3. PHP File Deployment Process ‚úÖ
- Successfully navigated Hostinger File Manager
- Located and edited ingest.php file
- Saved changes through web interface

## üîÑ What We Changed

### Lambda Changes (index-lambda.js)
```javascript
// Added after line 263 (after fixture transformation)
// Filter to only include fixtures within the next 7 days (today + 6 days)
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Start of today

const sevenDaysFromNow = new Date(today);
sevenDaysFromNow.setDate(sevenDaysFromNow.getDate() + 7); // End of 7th day

const filteredFixtures = transformedFixtures.filter(fixture => {
  const fixtureDate = new Date(fixture.date);
  return fixtureDate >= today && fixtureDate < sevenDaysFromNow;
});
```

### PHP Changes (ingest.php)
```php
// Replaced UPSERT logic with:
// DELETE ALL FIXTURES FIRST (clean slate approach)
$deleteSql = "DELETE FROM fixtures";
$deleteStmt = $pdo->prepare($deleteSql);
$deleteStmt->execute();
$stats['fixtures_deleted'] = $deleteStmt->rowCount();

// Now simple INSERT for all fixtures
$insertSql = "INSERT INTO fixtures (fixture_date, home_team, away_team, venue, competition, home_score, away_score, status, age_group, raw_data) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
```

## ‚úÖ Issue Resolution

### 1. SSH Deployment to Hostinger
- **Issue**: SSH requires password authentication
- **Attempted**: Both SCP and SSH pipe methods
- **Error**: Permission denied (password required)
- **Solution**: Used browser-based File Manager successfully

### 2. PHP Endpoint Runtime Error - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: ingest.php had duplicated content (11KB instead of 7KB)
- **Root Cause**: Content was duplicated during browser deployment
- **Solution**: Replaced with clean version via File Manager
- **Result**: Endpoint now working correctly (HTTP 200)

## üìö Important Processes Documented

### How to Deploy to Hostinger via Browser

#### Prerequisites
- Hostinger credentials (stored in `/HOSTINGER_CREDENTIALS.md`)
- Playwright MCP tool configured in Claude

#### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Launch Browser Session**
   ```
   Use Playwright MCP browser_navigate tool
   Navigate to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
   ```

2. **Login to Hostinger**
   - User will need to manually enter credentials
   - Or session may already be authenticated

3. **Navigate to File Manager for Subdomain**
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL**: Don't use the main File Manager link
   - Use the **search bar** at the top of hPanel
   - Search for: "file manager"
   - Select: "pages.urmstontownjfc.co.uk - File Manager"
   - This opens the correct subdomain's file system

4. **Navigate to Target File**
   ```
   public_html/ ‚Üí api/ ‚Üí fixtures/ ‚Üí [target file]
   ```

5. **Edit File**
   - Double-click file to open editor
   - Select all (Ctrl+A) to replace content
   - Paste new content
   - Click "Save" button

### How to Test the System

#### Test Lambda Function
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=footballclub
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name urmston-fixtures-scraper \
  --region eu-north-1 \
  output.json

cat output.json | jq
```

#### Test PHP Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST https://pages.urmstontownjfc.co.uk/api/fixtures/ingest.php \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer a8f3d2b1c9e4f7a6d5b8c3e2f1a9b4c7" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fixtures":[{"date":"2025-09-14","home_team":"Test","away_team":"Other","venue":"Venue"}]}'
```

#### Check Lambda Logs
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=footballclub
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/urmston-fixtures-scraper \
  --region eu-north-1 \
  --since 5m \
  --format short
```

## üö® Issue Discovered - 2025-09-13 17:40

### Enhanced Fixtures System - Duplicate Data Issue

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING - Needs Investigation
**Enhanced System Deployed**: ‚úÖ Working but has data integrity issue

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ Date grouping and sorting by time
- ‚úÖ Two-line display format (League || Pitch || Venue)
- ‚úÖ Airtable integration fetching pitch data successfully
- ‚úÖ Enhanced PHP file deployed to Hostinger
- ‚úÖ Frontend displaying enriched data correctly

### üêõ Issues Found:

#### 1. Duplicate Fixture IDs in API Response
**Location**: `get-enhanced.php` API endpoint
**Symptom**: React error "Encountered two children with the same key"
**Evidence**:
```json
// Sunday fixtures both have ID 51:
{
  "id": 51,
  "home_team": "West Didsbury & Chorlton AFC U16 Owls",
  "away_team": "Urmston Town Juniors U16 Storm",
  "formatted_time": "09:30"
}
{
  "id": 51,  // DUPLICATE!
  "home_team": "West Didsbury & Chorlton AFC U16 Owls",
  "away_team": "Urmston Town Juniors U16 Storm",
  "formatted_time": "09:30"
}
```

#### 2. Console 404 Error
**Symptom**: Browser console shows 404 error for some resource
**Status**: Not yet investigated

### üîç Investigation Needed:

1. **Check Enhanced PHP Logic**:
   - File: `/fixtures-scraper/hostinger/api/fixtures/get-enhanced.php`
   - Look for duplicate data creation in grouping logic
   - Check if Airtable enrichment is duplicating records

2. **Database Query Analysis**:
   - SQL query might be creating duplicates
   - Check if the grouping logic is properly handling unique records

3. **Airtable Integration Side Effects**:
   - Verify if enrichment process is accidentally duplicating fixtures
   - Check if cache file is causing duplicate entries

### üõ†Ô∏è Temporary Status:
- System is functional and displaying correct data
- React key conflict patched temporarily
- User should investigate root cause in PHP API

### üìç Files to Check:
- `/fixtures-scraper/hostinger/api/fixtures/get-enhanced.php` (deployed)
- `/components/fixtures-list-enhanced.tsx` (has temp fix)
- API endpoint: `https://pages.urmstontownjfc.co.uk/api/fixtures/get-enhanced.php`
